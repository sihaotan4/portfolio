# Si Hao's Portfolio

This is a collection of my data science work across various practice areas.

In my past role, I was working at an economic government agency with 3+ years of experience engaging C-level executives on industry business projects and economic strategy. 

As a data scientist, my area of interest is in forecasting business input prices in our economy. Singapore is an open economy and most economic inputs (including energy) are imported. 

As a result, our local businesses are highly exposed to input price volatility. Planning ahead is a key challenge for many businesses engaged in production and forecasts are an essential ingredient in strategic decision making.

# Projects in this repository

- **Shock Absorption: Forecasting Electricity Prices in Singapore** - In 2021, a confluence of economic factors caused local electricity prices to spike well above historical norms and the increased volatility shows no sign of abatement in 2022. Through first-hand interaction with local manufacturing companies, I have found that manufacturing firms are particularly exposed to this increased volatility. This has serious consequences on Singapore's competitiveness as a regional manufacturing hub. The project is still WIP so findings have yet to be uploaded to this portfolio. If you have expertise in Singapore's energy economy, I would love to connect with you.

- **Predicting the Sale Price of Houses in Ames** - Assisting a hypothetical real estate agency to predict the eventual sale price of a house, based on a large dataset of over 80 features. The business problem covers both prediction and inference - a) derive sale price **predictions**, and b) **infer** the strongest features that affect sale price. A number of business recommendations from house prospecting strategy to negotiation tactics are discussed as implications to the model deployment.
